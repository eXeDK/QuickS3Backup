QuickS3Backup
=============

Small backup script used to backup sites (both files and database) to S3 using a cronjob.

Install the composer dependencies using normal composer procedure: ```composer install```

This is a really quick and dirty job so a lot of improvements can be done. If you do so, please fork this repo so I can follow your great ideas. Thanks a bunch!
